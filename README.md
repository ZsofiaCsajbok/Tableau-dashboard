# Tableau-dashboard

Exported view of a dashboard I prepared in Tableau. The three panels show 1) a map with colour coded countries according to their mean depressive symptoms, and 2) linear regression lines fitted across countries to show the associations between year of education and the number of depressive symptoms, and 3) between the number of chronic diseases and the depressive symptoms.
